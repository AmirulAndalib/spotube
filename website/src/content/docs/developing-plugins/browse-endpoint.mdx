required method definitions.

```hetu_script
class BrowseEndpoint {
  var client: HttpClient

  construct (this.client)

  fun sections({offset: int, limit: int}) {
   // TODO: Implement method
  }

  fun sectionItems(id: string, {offset: int, limit: int}) {
    // TODO: Implement method
  }
}
```

| Method           | Description                              | Returns                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sections()`     | Returns the sections of the home page.   | [`SpotubePaginationResponseObject`][SpotubePaginationResponseObject] of [`SpotubeBrowseSectionObject`][SpotubeBrowseSectionObject] of `Object` |
| `sectionItems()` | Returns the items of a specific section. | [`SpotubePaginationResponseObject`][SpotubePaginationResponseObject] of `Object`                                                               |

> In `sectionItems()` The `id` it takes comes from `sections()`. It is basically used in an expanded screen to show the browse section items with pagination.
>
> For sections returned by `sections()` if `browseMore` is `true` that's when `sectionItems()` is used to fetch the items of that section.
